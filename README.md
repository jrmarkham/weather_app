Weather App

## Getting Started
Palmetto Programming Challenge
Weather App
This is a chance to challenge your creativity and coding prowess, by building a React app to display weather information. The UI implementation should prompt for a location, and display the resulting weather. There are several free weather APIs available to choose from. Pick one, consume it, and display the information you feel is relevant.

I hard code a location (New York City) for this sample. The plugin for 
location have security issues running on simulator/emulator, so I focused 
on the weather api. I stubbed out pages and code for expansion. A search 
feature and an around the world screen.
