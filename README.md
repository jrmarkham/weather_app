# Weather App

Palmetto Programming Challenge
Weather App

I hard code a location (New York City) for this sample. The various plugins for 
location have security issues running on simulator/emulator, so I focused 
on the weather api. I stubbed out pages and code for expansion. Stubbed 
Pages include: a search screen and an around the world screen. I organized the 
code for expanding features and functionality in a modular architecture. The idea being this 
would be part one of a prototype / real app.

Runs on iOS, Android and Web.
